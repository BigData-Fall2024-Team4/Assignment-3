Assets grew mainly as a result of the purchase of bonds, primarily Treasuries, as seen in Figure 5. On the liability side, bank reserves and security repos (Fed lending in the repurchase market) grew at rates of 90% and 165%.

Next we turn to the interpretation of the Fed's actions (balance sheet expansion and interest rate targeting) in the context of the fiscal theory.

## Phase 1 (2008): Liquidity Crisis, Unprecedented Bank Reserve Expansion, and Low Inflation

The standard quantity theory story for money creation and inflation (outlined previously) is that money is created either as currency (directly by the Fed) or as demand deposits (by banks using reserves supplied by the Fed). Reserves are a scarce and costly resource for banks, so the Fed's control of reserves (generally, prior to 2008, through interest rate policy and control of the Fed Funds rate) provides control over money growth. The quantity theory posits that money supply and prices are related through the equation MV = PQ. If money supply increases sharply in the short run (so that the level of economic activity or output, Q, is relatively constant), then the quantity theory posits that prices should increase sharply: inflation.

According to this story, the massive increase in reserves in late 2008 seen in Table 2 and Figure 1 should have produced a surge in inflation. In fact,

as can be seen in Figure 1 and Figure 6, prices fell in the immediate aftermath of 2008, and inflation remained moderate throughout the period.

The quantity theory is able to accommodate low inflation or even falling prices in the presence of rising reserves during a liquidity crisis such as 2008; so is the fiscal theory. The explanation for low inflation following the massive increase in reserves consists of two parts. The first involves fundamental quantity theory: Liquidity crises tend to produce low inflation. The second is a specific change in Fed procedures: The Fed started paying interest on reserves in 2008.

To understand why prices tend to go down during a liquidity crisis, it is critical to understand what is the "price of money." A widespread belief is that the interest rate is the price of money, and the tendency is to associate "low rates" with "cheap money." This belief is simply wrong. The (inverse of the) overall price level—say, the US Consumer Price Index or the Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index—is the price of money.

According to Friedman (1987, p. 15):

The "price" of money is the quantity of goods and services that must be given up to acquire a unit of money [a dollar bill].

Because the quantity theory is a theory of the supply and demand for money, thinking clearly about the price of money is absolutely crucial. Friedman continued:

[The "price" of money is thus] the inverse of the price level. This is the price that is analogous to the price of land or of copper or of haircuts. The "price" of money is not the interest rate, which is the "price" of credit.

Confusion over the price of money has acted and continues to act as a substantial hurdle to the correct understanding of monetary theory.
